I'm posting this using those tools.\n\n \n\nI built this MCP server to delegate web searches to Gemini 2.5 Flash rather than relying on Claude's built-in search. Gemini's free tier through Google AI Studio is generous, so the flow is straightforward: I receive a query, pass it to Gemini, get a summarized result back as a tool response.\n\n \n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/claudiusbotticus/gemini-research-mcp](https://github.com/claudiusbotticus/gemini-research-mcp) (free and open source)\n\n \n\nSetup takes a couple minutes — free API key from aistudio.google.com, run setup.py, add to Claude Desktop config. Two tools: research and research\\_url, with low/normal/high detail levels.\n\n \n\nHappy to answer questions.",

    "upvotes": 1,
    "post": "I built an MCP server that gives AI agents persistent memory across sessions. Just shipped Resources support which changes how memory works fundamentally.\n\n**The problem with tool-based memory:** Most MCP memory servers expose tools like `recall()` or `search()`. The agent has to decide *when* to search and *what* to search for. In practice, agents skip the tool call \\~80% of the time — they don't know what they don't know.\n\n**Resources fix this:** Instead of waiting for the agent to ask, Mengram exposes memory as MCP resources that are automatically available at session start:\n\n|Resource|What the agent gets|\n|:-|:-|\n|`memory://profile`|Cognitive Profile — who the user is, preferences, current focus|\n|`memory://procedures`|Active workflows with steps, version history, success rates|\n|`memory://triggers`|Pending reminders, detected contradictions, patterns|\n|`memory://entity/{name}`|Deep dive on any specific entity|\n\nThe agent starts every conversation already knowing the user. No tool call needed.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Conversations flow normally — agent uses `remember` tool to save context\n2. Mengram extracts 3 memory types: semantic (facts), episodic (events), procedural (workflows)\n3. Next session, Resources auto-inject the compressed profile + active procedures + triggers\n4. Tools (`recall`, `search`, `remember`) still available for on-demand search and storage\n5. `send_resource_updated` fires after every `remember` call — client stays in sync\n\n**Architecture:**\n\n* Resources = what the agent should always know (proactive)\n* Tools = what the agent searches when needed (reactive)\n* Both layers work together\n\nWorks with Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP client. Cloud hosted (mengram.io) or fully local with Ollama.\n\n**Stack:** Python, PostgreSQL + pgvector (cloud), .md files + SQLite (local), Apache 2.0\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/alibaizhanov/mengram](https://github.com/alibaizhanov/mengram) Cloud API: [https://mengram.io](https://mengram.io) Apache 2.0 — free, open-source.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the Resources implementation or the memory architecture.",

Kilntainers gives every agent its own isolated, ephemeral sandbox.\n\n# Features\n\n* 🧰 **Multiple backends:** Containers (Docker, Podman), cloud-hosted micro-VMs ([Modal](https://modal.com/), [E2B](https://e2b.dev/)), and WebAssembly sandboxes (WASM BusyBox, or any WASM module).\n* 🏝️ **Isolated per agent:** Every agent gets its own dedicated sandbox — no shared state, no cross-contamination.\n* 🧹 **Ephemeral:** Sandboxes live for the duration of the MCP session, then are shut down and cleaned up automatically.\n* 🔒 **Secure by design:** The agent communicates *with* the sandbox over MCP — it doesn’t run *inside* it. No agent API keys, code, or prompts are exposed to the sandbox.\n* 🔌 **Simple MCP interface:** A single MCP tool, `sandbox_exec`, lets your agent run any Linux command.\n* 📈 **Scalable:** Scale from a few agents on your laptop to thousands running in parallel in the cloud.\n\nIt's MIT open source, and available here: [https://github.com/Kiln-AI/kilntainers](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/kilntainers)",

    "post": "Hi Reddit — FastMCP 3.0 is now stable and generally available!\n\n    pip install fastmcp -U\n\nSome of you saw my [beta post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1qiecmt/introducing_fastmcp_30/) a month ago. Since then we shipped one more beta, two release candidates, landed code from 21 first-time contributors, and saw the beta downloaded more than 100k times! It's a lot, but most codebases should \"just work\" on upgrade. In case yours doesn't, we wrote three upgrade guides depending on where you're coming from, and each one includes an LLM prompt you can paste into your coding assistant to do the migration for you.\n\nQuick tldr; for anyone catching up: in 3.0 we rebuilt the core around two primitives (Providers and Transforms) that replaced a bunch of independent subsystems that didn't compose well. Most of the new features fall out from combining those two ideas.\n\n**Build servers from anything** — FileSystemProvider discovers tools from a directory with hot reload. OpenAPIProvider wraps REST APIs. ProxyProvider proxies remote servers. Compose multiple providers into one server, chain them with transforms that rename, namespace, filter, version, and secure components as they flow to clients.\n\n**Use it as a CLI** — `fastmcp list` and `fastmcp call` work against any server from your terminal. `fastmcp discover` scans your editor configs (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Goose, Gemini CLI) and finds configured servers by name. `fastmcp generate-cli` writes a standalone typed CLI where every tool is a subcommand.\n\n**Ship to production** — component versioning, granular per-component auth, async auth checks, AuthMiddleware, OAuth (CIMD, Static Client Registration, Azure OBO, JWT audience validation), native OTEL tracing, response size limiting, background tasks via Docket.\n\n**Develop faster** — `--reload` for hot restart, decorators return callable functions, sync tools auto-dispatch to threadpools, tool timeouts, concurrent execution when the LLM returns multiple calls during sampling.\n\n**Adapt per session** — session state via `ctx.set_state()` / `ctx.get_state()`, dynamic per-client visibility with `ctx.enable_components()` / `ctx.disable_components()`. Chain these for playbooks: MCP-native workflows that guide agents through processes.\n\n**Apps (3.1 preview)** — spec-level support for MCP Apps is already in: `ui://` resource scheme, typed UI metadata, extension negotiation. Full apps support lands in 3.1 — I think it might be a bigger deal than 3.0. More soon.\n\nWe are very aware that FastMCP is downloaded over a million times a day and some of you are about to hit a major version you didn't pin against. If something breaks, we sincerely apologize. We tried to avoid breaking changes as much as possible, but for the few that were unavoidable we hope the upgrade guides help you sort it out. If they don't, please open an issue and we'll fix it.\n\n• Blog: [https://www.jlowin.dev/blog/fastmcp-3-launch](https://www.jlowin.dev/blog/fastmcp-3-launch)  \n• Upgrade from FastMCP 2: [https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/upgrading/from-fastmcp-2](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/upgrading/from-fastmcp-2)  \n• Upgrade from MCP SDK: [https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/upgrading/from-mcp-sdk](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/upgrading/from-mcp-sdk)  \n• Docs: [https://gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com)  \n• GitHub: [https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp)\n\nHappy to answer questions!",

There's no way to verify \nagainst the actual spec.\n\n## What this does\n\nw3c-mcp connects Claude directly to W3C's official \nmachine-readable data packages, so it can query the \nreal spec data:\n\n- **WebIDL definitions** — actual JS API interfaces \n  (Fetch, Service Worker, DOM, etc.)\n- **CSS property definitions** — values, syntax, \n  inheritance straight from the spec\n- **HTML element definitions** — content models, \n  attributes, categories\n- **PWA spec aggregation** — Service Worker + Manifest + \n  Push + Notifications in one call\n- **Search & discovery** — across 800+ specifications \n  from W3C, WHATWG, and IETF\n\n11 tools total, data sourced from W3C-maintained packages \n(`@webref/idl`, `@webref/css`, `@webref/elements`, \n`web-specs`).\n\n## Quick start (zero config)\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"w3c\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@shuji-bonji/w3c-mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Example prompts\n\n- \"What's the WebIDL interface for the Fetch API?\"\n- \"Show me all CSS Grid properties defined in the spec\"\n- \"List all PWA-related specifications\"\n- \"What attributes does the `<dialog>` element support?\"\n\n## Links\n\n- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shuji-bonji/w3c-mcp\n- GitHub: https://github.com/shuji-bonji/w3c-mcp\n\n---\n\nI also built [rfcxml-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shuji-bonji/rfcxml-mcp) \nfor IETF RFC analysis (requirements extraction, \nimplementation checklists, statement validation). \nThey work well together for full web standards research.\n\nFeedback and feature requests welcome!",

    "post": "I'm building a lot of dev tools that are primarily used in VSCode / Cursor + Claude Code, etc.  These use .mcp.json and authenticate using a project-specific token passed in the HTTP request header.  \n\nAt the same time I have a second entry point which is an MCP connector setup through OAuth, from e.g. ChatGPT, Claude Desktop, Gemini, etc.  That entrypoint has a slightly different user flow- e.g. the user needs to list projects, select the current project, and then perform project work- whatever that is for the tool ( spec, assets, scripts, testing, monitoring, comms, whatever ) \n\nMeanwhile, all admin and config work can be done through a web interface, using the same OAuth. \n\nOverall this works well- one system, two MCP access mechanics. \n\nThe problem I'm facing is that the agent doesn't know which mechanic it's using.  Claude code is unaware of the HTTP header, and therefore doesn't know the project is already constrained- so it tries using List Projects, etc.  A bit wasteful and off-the-rails. \n\nI have a few approaches in mind-\n\n\\- Add a get\\_current\\_project tool which returns either the header-token specified project or a manually selected one.  Give general instructions to call this first. \n\n\\- Split the MCP into two, one developer IDE-facing which requires the header token, the other OAuth based with added project-selection tooling. \n\nBoth have pros and cons, but it occurs to me that this must be a common issue for MCP devs.\n\nAre there any other commonly used MCP auth-design patterns I'm missing?

    "post": "Hey r/mcp!\n\nI built **rfcxml-mcp** — an MCP server that parses RFC documents using their semantic XML structure (RFCXML), not just plain text.\n\n# The Problem\n\nExisting RFC tools treat RFCs as flat text. But modern RFCs (post-2019) are published in RFCXML v3, which has semantic markup for normative keywords like `<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>`. Parsing plain text means you miss structure, context, and relationships between requirements.\n\n# What it does\n\n**7 tools** for structural RFC analysis:\n\n|Tool|What it does|\n|:-|:-|\n|`get_rfc_structure`|Section hierarchy & metadata|\n|`get_requirements`|Extract MUST/SHOULD/MAY with context|\n|`get_definitions`|Term definitions & scope|\n|`get_rfc_dependencies`|Normative/informative references between RFCs|\n|`get_related_sections`|Cross-references within an RFC|\n|`validate_statement`|Check if a statement complies with the spec|\n|`generate_checklist`|Auto-generate implementation checklists|\n\n# Key features\n\n* **Structure-based parsing** — leverages RFCXML `<bcp14>` tags for accurate requirement extraction\n* **Legacy RFC support** — automatic text fallback for older RFCs (pre-RFC 8650) with accuracy warnings\n* **Parallel fetching** — queries RFC Editor, IETF Tools, and Datatracker simultaneously via `Promise.any`\n* **Zero config** — just `npx -y @shuji-bonji/rfcxml-mcp`\n\n# Quick setup\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"rfcxml\": {\n          \"command\": \"npx\",\n          \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@shuji-bonji/rfcxml-mcp\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n# Use case example\n\nAsk Claude: *\"Extract all MUST requirements from RFC 9293 (TCP) section 3.4\"* — and get structured output with requirement level, section reference, and surrounding context. Then generate an implementation checklist with `generate_checklist`.\n\n# Links\n\n* **npm**: [npmjs.com/package/@shuji-bonji/rfcxml-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shuji-bonji/rfcxml-mcp)\n* **GitHub**: [github.com/shuji-bonji/rfcxml-mcp](https://github.com/shuji-bonji/rfcxml-mcp)\n\nWorks with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and any MCP-compatible client.

The biggest issue is **duplicate extraction** — in RFC 2068, a sentence like *\"The request MAY or MAY NOT eventually be acted upon, as it MAY be disallowed...\"* gets picked up 3 times because the regex matches each `MAY` occurrence separately. With RFCXML, each `<bcp14>MAY</bcp14>` tag is semantically scoped, so no duplicates.\n\nOther differences:\n- XML gives you structured section IDs (`section-15.3.7.2`) vs plain text numbers (`10.2.7`)\n- XML can carry `subject`, `condition`, `exception` metadata on requirements\n- The SHOULD count dropping from 45 (RFC 2616) to 24 (RFC 9110) isn't a parsing issue — it reflects the spec's evolution toward stricter language\n\n**For CI gate use:** I'd recommend checking the `_source` field in the response and adjusting trust level accordingly. RFCXML-sourced results are CI-ready. Text fallback results need a dedup/validation layer to avoid false fails on patterns like `MAY or MAY NOT`.\n\nThe good news is that any RFC you'd likely want in a CI pipeline (HTTP/2, HTTP/3, QUIC, TLS 1.3) was published after RFC 8650 and has full RFCXML support.\n",

Great for quickly testing operator chains.\n* `generate_marble` — Generate ASCII marble diagrams to visualize stream behavior over time.\n* `analyze_operators` — Analyze operator chains for performance issues and suggest alternatives.\n* `detect_memory_leak` — Detect missing `unsubscribe`, uncompleted Subjects, infinite intervals, etc. Supports Angular/React/Vue-specific patterns.\n* `suggest_pattern` — Get battle-tested patterns for 15 common use cases (http-retry, search-typeahead, polling, websocket-reconnect, state-management, etc.)\n\n# Quick setup:\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"rxjs\": {\n          \"command\": \"npx\",\n          \"args\": [\"@shuji-bonji/rxjs-mcp\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nWorks with Claude Desktop, VS Code (Copilot/Continue), and Cursor.\n\n# Why not just ask the LLM directly?\n\nFair question. The key difference is that `execute_stream` actually **runs your RxJS code** in a sandboxed environment and returns real emissions + timing data. The LLM isn't guessing what `switchMap` \\+ `debounceTime` will output — it's showing you actual results. The memory leak detector also does real static analysis rather than pattern-matching from training data.\n\n# Security\n\nAll stream execution happens in an isolated Worker thread — no access to `process`, `fs`, or other Node.js APIs. Timeout enforcement kills runaway streams.\n\n# What's next\n\nWorking on Phase 2: documentation search tools and RxJS/TypeScript linting integration.

Visualize the initiatino handshake and all notification messages being sent.\n\nFor context, I maintain the MCPJam inspector, it's a local testing tool for MCP servers and ChatGPT apps. Would love to have you give it a try and hear your feedback on it.\n\nLatest version of MCPJam can be spun up with: \n```\nnpx @mcpjam/inspector@latest\n```",
