    "post": "Hey HN!<p>One of the big selling points of AI agents like OpenClaw is the ability to connect it to popular communication tools  like Slack, Discord, Mattermost, Telegram. But this shouldn&#x27;t need to be reimplemented. A single tool can provide this interface for all of them.<p>That&#x27;s what Pantalk does. It&#x27;s a local daemon that maintains persistent connections to chat platforms, and any agent (regardless of language, framework, or runtime) talks through plain CLI commands or a Unix domain socket with a JSON protocol.<p>Your agent doesn&#x27;t import a library. It calls a command. That means it works with Claude, Codex, Copilot and Gemini, local models, custom frameworks, a bash script or anything that can exec a process or write to a socket.<p>It outputs JSON when stdout isn&#x27;t a terminal, and ships with &quot;skill&quot; definitions that teach agents what commands are available (kind of like man pages for LLMs).<p>Some things that might be interesting to this crowd:<p>* IPC is JSON over Unix domain socket. The CLI is just a thin client. You can write your own in any language.<p>* Everything is local. Message history and notifications are persisted in SQLite. No cloud, no external DB.<p>* Multi-bot. One daemon can manage multiple bots across different platforms simultaneously.<p>* Hot reload. Change your config and run pantalk reload - no restart needed.<p>It supports Slack (Socket Mode), Discord (Gateway), Mattermost (WebSocket), and Telegram (Bot API).<p>Written in Go, single binary, MIT licensed.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pantalk&#x2F;pantalk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pantalk&#x2F;pantalk</a><p>Website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantalk.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantalk.dev</a><p>I&#x27;d love feedback on the protocol design and what other platforms people would want to see.

So I tried something: what if the agents told me?<p>PatchworkMCP is a feedback tool you drop into any MCP server (Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust — one file each). When an agent hits a wall — missing tool, incomplete data, wrong format — it calls the feedback tool with structured details about what it needed, what it tried, and what would have helped.<p>The feedback goes to a FastAPI sidecar with a review dashboard. You can browse the gaps, add notes, and click &quot;Draft PR&quot; — it reads your GitHub repo, sends the feedback + code context to an LLM, and opens a draft pull request.<p>The interesting finding: agents actually give surprisingly specific feedback. When I wired this into an AI cost management MCP server, Claude reported a missing `search_costs_by_context` tool, described the exact input schema it wanted (context key-value pairs with AND logic, combined with standard filters, paginated results), and that became a working tool within minutes.<p>The whole sidecar is one Python file. No Docker, no build step. The drop-ins are one file each with zero deps beyond the MCP SDK + an HTTP client.<p>This is early — right now it&#x27;s a developer tool for when you&#x27;re actively building and need fast signal. The longer-term idea is a self-monitoring system: feedback accumulates, gets deduplicated and clustered, and the system proposes changes when confidence is high. But today it&#x27;s just capture → review → draft PR.<p>Curious if others building MCP servers have found good ways to figure out what tools are actually needed vs. what you think is needed.",

I got curious whether you could make a <i>usable</i> serverless platform out of languages that were never intended for this.<p>OtherFunc is a serverless function platform for languages no major cloud provider (to my knowledge) supports. There are currently implementations of brainfuck, Forth, APL, Lisp (Scheme-like), and BASIC.<p>The interpreters are written in Rust, compiled to a single Wasm binary, and deployed on Cloudflare Workers. You can finally write Forth and publish it as an HTTP endpoint. You can see some examples on the showcase page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;otherfunc.com&#x2F;showcase\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;otherfunc.com&#x2F;showcase</a><p>- brainfuck can make HTTP requests. The tape is extended to 33,000 cells with a memory-mapped I&#x2F;O region. You write a URL to cells 30,000+, set a method byte, trigger execution, and the response appears in cells 31,000+. The Brainfuck program to do this runs ~35,000 characters, but it works.<p>- The interpreters use a coroutine&#x2F;yield pattern for I&#x2F;O instead of async. When code needs to make an HTTP call or access KV storage, the interpreter suspends with an IoRequest, the Worker performs the fetch, then resumes execution with the response.<p>- There&#x27;s an MCP server so AI assistants can deploy functions directly. The thought was, if an LLM is writing all your code anyway, the language it is written in doesn&#x27;t really matter. But you probably don&#x27;t want to waste your tokens writing bf either.<p>Code is available here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;otherfunc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;otherfunc</a>",

    "post": "MCP servers are proliferating fast, but most have vague tool descriptions and incomplete schemas that make LLMs pick the wrong tool or fill parameters incorrectly.<p>AgentDX is a CLI that measures this. Two commands:<p>- `npx agentdx lint` — static analysis of tool descriptions, schemas, and naming. 18 rules, zero config, no API key. Produces a lint score.<p>- `npx agentdx bench` — sends your tool definitions to an LLM (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Ollama) and evaluates tool selection accuracy, parameter correctness, ambiguity handling, multi-tool orchestration, and error recovery. Produces an Agent DX Score (0-100).<p>It auto-detects the server entry point, spawns it, connects as an MCP client, and reads tools via the protocol. Bench auto-generates test scenarios from your tool definitions.<p>Built in TypeScript, MIT licensed. Early alpha — the bench command works but is slow (sequential LLM calls, parallelization is next). Feedback welcome.",

    "post": "Hi HN! I&#x27;m building poncho, a framework for building custom AI agents that are version-controlled in git, developed locally, and deployed as isolated endpoints (serverless-friendly by default).<p>Poncho agents follow the same conventions as openclaw or claude code so they probably feel familiar.<p>You can talk to them via terminal or web ui to build new skills or configure the agent, and they&#x27;re compatible with the Agent Skills open spec, so you can port your skills. Small caveat: right now it&#x27;s compatible with .md skills and js&#x2F;ts scripts, but many skills are bash or python-based. I&#x27;m still figuring out what would be the best way to extend support for those skills without overcomplicating it, if anybody has any ideas I appreciate it!<p>Some features:<p>- Git-native: agent behavior, skills, and tests live in your repository (reviewable diffs + easy rollbacks).\n- Single-file agent definition: define runtime config + instructions in AGENT.md (YAML frontmatter + prompt content).\n- Skills you can ship: AgentSkills-style skills&#x2F;*&#x2F;SKILL.md plus TypeScript&#x2F;JavaScript scripts under scripts&#x2F;.\n- MCP support: connect remote tool servers and inject required environment variables through config.\n- Conversation-first API + streaming: stored conversations with SSE streaming responses and tool events.\n- Pluggable storage + memory: local files for dev or hosted stores (e.g. Upstash), with optional persistent memory + recall.\n- Testing + observability: poncho test workflows and OpenTelemetry traces&#x2F;events.<p>Now the cool thing about poncho agents is that they&#x27;re super easy to deploy to Vercel&#x2F;Fly&#x2F;Lambda&#x2F;etc, so you can share them with anybody in your team and enable non-technical people with custom skills.<p>I also built and deployed a couple example agents here:\n- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cesr&#x2F;product-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cesr&#x2F;product-agent</a>\n- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cesr&#x2F;marketing-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cesr&#x2F;marketing-agent</a><p>I&#x27;d love some feedback, I started building poncho because I wanted a fast and easy way to build and share agents with my team. Let me know what you think!",

    "post": "I built PolyMCP, a framework and runtime for exposing Python functions as MCP tools, serving them via standardized MCP servers, and orchestrating them with autonomous agents that can plan and execute multi‑step workflows.<p>PolyMCP is more than just an MCP server: it turns existing Python code into agent‑ready tools and gives agents the ability to discover, compose, and orchestrate across multiple services with adaptive planning and real‑world execution support.<p>Key parts of the ecosystem:<p>1) Expose Python functions as MCP tools\nUse existing Python functions directly as MCP tools without rewriting them:<p>from polymcp.polymcp_toolkit import expose_tools_http<p>def add(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:\n    return a + b<p>app = expose_tools_http([add], title=&quot;Math Tools&quot;)<p>Type hints automatically generate structured tool schemas, and input&#x2F;output validation and error handling are included. Multiple functions can be exposed on the same server.<p>2) Autonomous agent: PolyClaw\nPolyClaw goes beyond tool calling. It:\n • Decomposes complex tasks into executable steps\n • Selects and orchestrates MCP tools dynamically\n • Starts or connects to MCP servers on demand\n • Validates outputs before proceeding\n • Adapts plans when execution fails\n • Runs everything in isolated Docker containers<p>Example run:<p>polymcp agent run \\\n  --type polyclaw \\\n  --query &quot;Build a sales reporting pipeline and test it end‑to‑end&quot; \\\n  --model minimax‑m2.5:cloud \\\n  --verbose<p>Under the hood, the system plans, provisions infrastructure as needed, executes steps sequentially or in parallel, and handles adaptive replanning when something fails.<p>Why this matters<p>Most AI agent systems today either call tools statically or assume the infrastructure already exists. PolyMCP instead:\n • Makes existing Python code agent‑ready with minimal friction\n • Standardizes tools via MCP so multiple agents and services can interact with them\n • Provides autonomous orchestration across multiple services\n • Spins up infrastructure dynamically when needed\n • Validates step results and recovers from failures\n • Uses Docker for safe, isolated execution<p>PolyMCP is useful for enterprise automation, DevOps workflows, data pipelines, internal tooling orchestration, and any complex multi‑tool reasoning tasks where agents must plan and execute reliably.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;poly‑mcp&#x2F;PolyMCP\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;poly‑mcp&#x2F;PolyMCP</a><p>Happy to answer questions.",
